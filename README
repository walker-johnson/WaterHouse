   This Geant4 Application will be used to test multiple configurations of shielding
   materials and thicknesses for the safe operation of a DD Generator in a lab setting
   
 1- MATERIALS AND GEOMETRY DEFINITION

   The geometry is a neutron source surrounded by a definable thickness of Borated Polyethelyne,
   and a definable thickness of lead. The shielding has a window, and a neutron monitor is
   located in line with the window. Surrounding the neutron monitor is a water tank with a
   definable thickness. Around this whole system are 4 test volumes to measure the flux
   at different distances
   TV1 - 0.5m
   TV2 - 1.0m
   TV3 - 1.5m
   TV4 - 2.0m

 3- AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
   The primary kinematic is a single particle isomorphically shot from the centre of the
   DD Generator location. The type of the particle and its energy are set in 
   PrimaryGeneratorAction (neutron 2.5 MeV), and can be changed via the G4 
   build-in commands of ParticleGun class (see the macros provided with 
   this example

 5- HISTOGRAMS
         
   The test contains 10 built-in 1D histograms, which are managed by
   G4AnalysisManager and its Messenger. The histos can be individually 
   activated with the command :
   /analysis/h1/set id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
   where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, etc..)
   (see the macros xxxx.mac).
   
            1   "KE of neutrons leaving the shielding"
            2   "KE of neutrons leaving test volume 1"
            3   "KE of neutrons leaving test volume 2"
            4   "KE of neutrons leaving test volume 3"
            5   "KE of neutrons leaving test volume 4"
	    6   "KE of gammas leaving the shielding"
            7   "KE of gammas leaving test volume 1"
            8   "KE of gammas leaving test volume 2"
            9   "KE of gammas leaving test volume 3"
            10   "KE of gammas leaving test volume 4"   
      
   The histograms are managed by the HistoManager class and its Messenger. 
   The histos can be individually activated with the command :
   /analysis/h1/set id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
   where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, deg or mrad, etc..)
   
   One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
   /analysis/setFileName  name  (default Hadr04)
   
   It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file : root (default),
   xml, csv, by using namespace in HistoManager.hh
       
   It is also possible to print selected histograms on an ascii file:
   /analysis/h1/setAscii id
   All selected histos will be written on a file name.ascii (default Hadr04)

   Additionally Ntuples of the format
   ___________________________________________________
   | x-position | y-position | z-position | KE | tag |
   ---------------------------------------------------

   are generated at each boundary that the particles may cross (one each for neutrons
   and gammas) ie. the polyethylene -> lead boundary, the lead -> TV1 boundary, the TV1 -> TV2
   boundary, etc
 	 				
 6- VISUALIZATION
 
   The Visualization Manager is set in the main().
   The initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
   /vis/... in the macro vis.mac. To get visualisation:
   > /control/execute vis.mac
 	
   The detector has a default view which is a longitudinal view of the box.
   The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.
	
 7- HOW TO START ?
 
   Execute Hadr04 in 'batch' mode from macro files :
 	% Hadr04  macro.mac
 		
   Execute Hadr04 in 'interactive mode' with visualization :
 	% Hadr04
        ....
 	Idle> type your commands
 	....
 	Idle> exit
